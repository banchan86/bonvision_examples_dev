## Suzanne, created using Blender (original model from Willem-Paul van Overbruggen)

Created in 2002 for Blender version 2.25 by 3D concept artist Willem-Paul van Overbruggen, Suzanne is basically a slightly more complicated three-dimensional mesh than most primitives, consisting of 500 faces and capable of casting shadows and reflections on itself.

## Blue Marble, from MODIS instruments on NASA’s Terra satellite

This spectacular “blue marble” image is the most detailed true-color image of the entire Earth to date. Using a collection of satellite-based observations, scientists and visualizers stitched together months of observations of the land surface, oceans, sea ice, and clouds into a seamless, true-color mosaic of every square kilometer (.386 square mile) of our planet. These images are freely available to educators, scientists, museums, and the public.
